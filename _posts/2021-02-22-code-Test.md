> If you host your code on GitHub, you can use GitHub Pages to host your project.

Fork this repo and switch to the gh-pages branch.
If you're using a custom domain name, modify the CNAME file to point to your new domain.
If you're not using a custom domain name, modify the baseurl in _config.yml to point to your GitHub Pages URL. Example: for a repo at github.com/username/poole, use http://username.github.io/poole/. Be sure to include the trailing slash.
Done! Head to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain.
No matter your production or hosting setup, be sure to verify the baseurl option file and CNAME settings. Not applying this correctly can mean broken styles on your site.
